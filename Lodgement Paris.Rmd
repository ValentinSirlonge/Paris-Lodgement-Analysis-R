<p class="title-main">Introduction</p>
Housing affordability and rental regulations are key topics in urban development and policy-making. In cities like Paris, where space is limited, and demand for housing is high, understanding rental trends is crucial for both tenants and policymakers. This report focuses on analyzing **rental data from Paris**, aiming to uncover patterns in reference rents, rental types, and construction periods.

Using advanced data analysis techniques and interactive visualizations, this study highlights how rents vary across neighborhoods, room types, and building characteristics. By leveraging insights from this analysis, stakeholders can better understand the dynamics of the Parisian rental market.

This data was sourced from open government databases and covers essential aspects of the rental market, such as room counts, construction periods, and rent types.
\
\

<p class="title-sub">Key Information:</p>
- **Year**: The year of reference for the rent data.
- **Quarter**: The geographic area in Paris where the data is applicable.
- **District**: The arrondissement in Paris to which the geographic area belongs.
- **Construction Period**: The period when the building was constructed.
- **Rental Type**: Whether the property is furnished or unfurnished.
- **Reference Rent (€ / m²)**: The baseline rent per square meter set by regulations.
- **High Reference Rent (€ / m²)**: The maximum allowable rent under regulation.
- **Low Reference Rent (€ / m²)**: The minimum allowable rent under regulation.
- **Location (Latitude and Longitude)**: Geographic coordinates of the neighborhood.

\

The table highlights the **minimum and maximum rents per year** from 2019 to 2024 in Paris. While the maximum rent shows a slight increase from **39.30 €/m² in 2019** to **40.70 €/m² in 2024**, the minimum rent remains relatively stable, hovering around **14.60 €/m²** since 2020. This stability in minimum rents might suggest regulatory controls or limited changes in the lower-end rental market. The sharpest increase in maximum rents occurs between **2023 and 2024**, rising by **0.90 €/m²**, which may point to high-end properties driving the growth. This divergence between minimum and maximum rent trends could indicate increasing inequality in the rental market, with high-end properties becoming less affordable over time.

The table illustrates the **average rent by rental type in 2024**, showing a clear difference between furnished and unfurnished properties. Furnished rentals have a significantly higher average rent of **28.87 €/m²**, compared to **25.33 €/m²** for unfurnished ones. This difference of **3.54 €/m²** reflects the added value or convenience associated with furnished properties, which often cater to short-term tenants or those seeking a fully-equipped living space. The data suggests that landlords of furnished properties can charge a premium due to increased demand or reduced tenant flexibility. This gap highlights the need for tenants to carefully consider their priorities when choosing between furnished and unfurnished options.

The video provides a fascinating overview of the origins and evolution of Paris **20 arrondissements**, emphasizing their unique "snail-shaped" layout. Initially, Paris had only 12 arrondissements when they were created in **1795**, organized in two lines along the Seine. The city's expansion in **1860**, led by Haussmann, incorporated surrounding communes, resulting in the current spiral configuration. The video also highlights the cultural and social significance of the arrondissements. For example, districts in the **west** like the 16th symbolize wealth and exclusivity, while those in the **north and east** like the 18th, 19th, and 20th are more affordable and diverse, home to many immigrants. Interestingly, the video notes how the number **13** was deliberately assigned to a less affluent area due to its historical association with concubinage, showcasing the influence of social perceptions on urban planning. This engaging narrative deepens the viewer's appreciation for Paris's rich history and the cultural identity of its neighborhoods.

## <span style="color: black;">Conclusion</span>

<p class="title-main">Conclusion</p>

Analyzing rental prices in Paris reveals several interesting trends. 

**First**, there is a progressive increase in average rents between 2019 and 2024, highlighting growing tension in the Parisian housing market, likely driven by increased demand and economic pressures. High-end neighborhoods such as *Invalides* and *Ecole-Militaire* showcase a concentration of premium properties, while more affordable areas, like the 19th and 20th districts, remain attractive options for budget-conscious tenants.

**Additionally**, the analysis by rental type shows that **furnished apartments** consistently command higher rents than unfurnished ones, reflecting a preference for move-in-ready properties, particularly in central areas. Furthermore, the distribution of rents by the number of rooms indicates a **decline in rent per square meter for larger properties**, suggesting cost efficiency for tenants seeking more space.

**Moreover**, variations based on construction periods highlight that properties built before 1946 tend to have higher maximum rents, likely due to their central locations and historical appeal. However, recently built properties offer competitive options, showcasing efforts in urban development and modernization in select neighborhoods.

Finally, **interactive maps and graphical visualizations** enhance the understanding of the data by providing a geographic perspective, emphasizing the stark contrasts between different districts and neighborhoods. This project demonstrates how **data-driven approaches** enable precise insights into the dynamics of the Parisian rental market. Ultimately, these analyses could guide decision-makers, investors, and tenants in making strategic choices in the real estate sector.
